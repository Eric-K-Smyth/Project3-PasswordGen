## Description

This projects motivation was to create a randomized password that can meet specific criteria. 
This project was built to be able to create passwords with greater security to safely store sensitive data.
This project solves the problem of passwords being too predictable. By being random it will be harder to guess.
I learned how to utilize the Math.random function to randomly pick elements from an array.

## Installation

The generator runs in browser. No installation needed.

## Usage

Start by clicking the big red "Generate password" button.
Follow the prompts that appear at the top of the screen.
When selecting character types. Clicking "OK" will include them in the final result.
The final result will print within the large central text box. Copy and paste the result in the password bar you want to set in another application
Tip: Save password somewhere secure.
